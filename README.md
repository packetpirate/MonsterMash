# Monster Mash

### Description
```
Monster Mash is my entry for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam. The theme is "You Are the Monster".
The idea of the game jam is to create a game in a 48-72 hour time period (depends if you're
participating in the compo or the jam -- in my case, the jam). My game lets you play as a Necromancer
(who is as yet, unnamed), who controls an army of the undead and cast spells to destroy villages and
the people that live in them so that they can be used to create more undead!
```

### Controls
```
WASD - Move your character.
P - Pause/Unpause the game.
Left Mouse - Cast selected spell.
